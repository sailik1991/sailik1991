### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work in Natural Language Understanding as a Senior Scientist at Amazon. I am an alumnus of Arizona State University (PhD), Jadavpur Univeristy (B.E), and St. Xavier's Collegiate School. My code contributions don't always represent the identity I work for/with.

I am a disciple of the [Tao of Programming](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html) and a follower of [Clean Cod(e)](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)ing practices. In my past life (before joining PhD), I was a software engineer by day and a security certifier by night. Over time, my interest has shifted to build robust AI systems by leveraging my knowledge and skills in multi-agent systems (game-theory, planning, RL), machine learning (generative networks, randomized ensembles), and cyber-security (network, web, and cloud security).

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to eat lots of food, enjoy photography (+ travel) and listen to a wide variety of music.
